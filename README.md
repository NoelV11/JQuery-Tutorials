This repository is dedicated towards discuessing JQuery concepts.It is a lite version of JavaScript, which offers more functionality in the form of Event Handling.We implement JQuery,using a js file(jquery-3.5.1.min.js),stated in the script part of the document 

## Functioality Provided:-

Generally, Web Programmers apply JQuery functionality by a file(jquery-3.5.1.min.js),stated in the script part of the document

Here,I will demonstrate the working of JsQuery_dblclick().html

From the name itself,it is understandable that the user needs to double click,over something to,implement a JQuery funnction.
In this example,when the user double clicks over the text,each line dissapears (one line dissapears,for each click)
